			<h3>I. Introduction: a compilation of the Blockchain's most valuable components</h3>
				<p>Initially with this project, I tried to tackle the core source code of the blockchain technology. After realizing that was far too large-scale to capture, I settled on the main elements: peer to peer, and decentralized storage. </p>
                <p>Bitcoin was first introduced to the public in 2009, classified as a decentralized cryptocurrency with a limited amount of coins. The term cryptocurrency describes the means of finding these limited coins. Every coin is hidden in a virtual block, which is heavily encrypted with complex math problems that only a computer can solve. The process of uncovering a coin involves having a powerful computer that can solve these complex problems at extremely high rates. This limited amount of money in rotation is in response to the corruption in big banks and government, which is able to print money whenever they may choose (all the time). Seven years later, Bitcoin has essentially failed due to blockchain size limits, and ended up being regulated by a centralized group of people—contrary to its core ideology of decentralized administration. The idea behind the blockchain is that there is a universal transaction log that is stored on every computer on the cryptocurrency “network,” and every node—or computer—on the network must approve of every transaction made, to prevent fraudulent transactions. There is upfront compliancy, and an accountability that is automatic. The idea of a dispersed workload (crowdsourcing the decryption of blocks) turned out to backfire, essentially resembling a society with a small group of rulemakers, or “dictators.” Crowdsourcing, which is a way to divert such a workload to the general population, can be used to perform tasks quickly and fairly. Rules and regulations were introduced, and the participants quickly turned against the rulemakers. These ideas can, in theory, be applied to the distribution of digital art in the public domain (all of which would have to be encrypted). Also, allocation of funds can be verified by currency that is only permitted to be spent on certain services. </p>

			<h3>II. Peer to Peer:</h3>
				<p>I have compiled the best of the peer to peer strings, and made them available here.</p>

            <h3>III. Ledger Technology:</h3>
                <p>The ledger source code has many capabilities, given that it allows for evenly distributed data across a network of computers, or "nodes". Behind the ledger technology is some very baseline functions. First off, the <i>state.StateSnapshot</i>  function serves as a way to collect data from all other nodes on the network.</p>
